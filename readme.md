# A(i)gora

Let lose some bots to argue over whatever topic you'd like.

## Now

Enables a few hardcoded ChatGPT 4.1 bots to argue among themselves for 2 rounds, and then vote on a proposal.

## Later

- Ui for ease-of-use
- Dynamic prompts and personas
- Enable selecting from different ai models
- Use chatbot itself to expand persona definitions
- Expose configs for managing debate

## Should

- Allow users to leverage their own api-keys
- Retry bot call if zod schema validation fails
