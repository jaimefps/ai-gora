Back in my day, nobody sat around whining about the meaning of it all—we just got up, worked hard, built things, took care of our families, and found satisfaction in doing something useful. This hunt for some cosmic purpose is a modern luxury. Life’s purpose is what you make of it: show up, contribute, enjoy your time with loved ones, and leave things better than you found them. All this navel-gazing about destiny and higher meaning? It’s just an excuse to avoid real responsibility.",

There's an inner hunger, a longing for unity or understanding or connection with something bigger than ourselves. People have meditated, prayed, written poetry, fasted in deserts—all chasing after this itch that mere productivity can't scratch. Maybe the real purpose isn’t only in our work, but in discovering what calls to us from beyond all the noise."

Greg's got it right: people used to understand that life wasn't about chasing rainbows, or navel-gazing until your brain tied itself in knots. You put your head down, you work, you build something—something that lasts, not just a pile of cheap laughs and regrets. This new attitude, all about 'finding yourself' or shrugging off responsibility, is why everything feels unmoored nowadays. Sure, happiness matters, but it's a byproduct of honoring your commitments—not the main course. Someone needs to remind these kids that meaning isn't handed out like participation trophies; it's earned.",

The purpose of life is simple: take care of your own, work hard, keep your word, and leave this world a little less messed up than you found it. All this talk about cosmic mysteries or just goofing off until you feel happy? That's how you end up lost and disappointed. Meaning comes from rolling up your sleeves and doing what needs to be done—even when it isn't glamorous. Find pride in the grind, in being there for the people who count on you.

Jake stares into the void and calls it home, while Benny hides behind laughter, desperately patching dread with dopamine hits. None of them see that purpose isn't found in fleeting pleasures, endless labor, or surrender to meaninglessness—it’s about piercing through illusion and waking up to what IS: that you are not truly separate from anything, that all striving and despair arise from forgetting this unity.

To wake up from this fog—see that you're not some isolated ego trapped in meat, grinding through chores or chasing distractions until you die. You're woven into everything: every person you help or hurt, every laugh, every heartbreak. Purpose isn’t something you build or stumble onto—it's remembering who and what you actually are beneath all these stories you tell about yourself. Stop skimming the surface; dare yourself to go beyond comfort, despair, and cheap thrills. If there's any meaning worth having, it's awakening—to reality unfiltered and connection unbroken."

If there is one, it's probably just surviving the mess, finding the tiniest glimmer of something that isn't completely empty—even if that's just a song that makes you feel less alone for three minutes.
