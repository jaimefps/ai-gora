Do I think there’s some universal objective purpose? Meh, probably not (and if there is, the tutorial level was NOT clear). Do we all find our own meaning? Yeah—sometimes it’s chasing careers or art or falling down Wikipedia holes at 2am. Or maybe we just meme our way through until something sticks.\n\nThe point is: Purpose isn’t handed down from some deity (or forum mod) or found blooming in a field; it’s cobbled together from all the weirdness and vibes of being alive right now. So let’s stop looking for The Answer™ and start making the ride a little more fun—and maybe help each other not trip over our own shoelaces while we’re at it."

These are not just cultural artifacts; they're proven pillars that give life structure and direction. Of course, each person brings their individuality to these traditions, but dismissing objective or shared meaning altogether leads to confusion and instability.

Perhaps it is found in the way water reflects sky at dawn, how it nourishes roots unseen, how it carves earth gently over ages. Might we find purpose less in seeking singular answers than in listening to all these currents?\n\nWhen night falls on the water, does the river wonder where it goes—or simply become part of something greater? In our own journey, may we learn to dwell in this mystery: honoring tradition without being bound by it, shaping meaning without clutching for certainty, and always allowing new tributaries to join our search."

While I respect the human need for exploration, I see a lack of seriousness about what makes societies stable and lives truly fulfilling over the long term. History is littered with examples of people losing direction when they cast aside shared standards. Younger generations often underestimate how much their sense of purpose—however personal—relies on inherited frameworks. It's easy to romanticize forging your own way, but most people eventually come back to what has lasted: family, faith, responsibility. These aren't just comfort blankets—they're hard-won structures that guide us through hardship and shape character.",

While it’s fashionable today to claim that meaning is purely subjective or endlessly fluid, I would caution against underestimating the value of tradition and shared standards. It’s these very principles—family, duty, community—that have given countless generations resilience and fulfillment, even in the face of hardship. We should not abandon them lightly in favor of novelty or ambiguity; instead, we ought to appreciate their depth and recognize that true purpose often emerges from committing ourselves to responsibilities greater than our own immediate desires."
