Are there circumstances or fields in which forgoing a traditional four-year degree might be more beneficial, and how should individuals weigh the trade-offs between formal education, alternative pathways, and real-world experience when making this decision?",

        "secret_thoughts": "Ugh, this again. Everyone acts like college is the only way to not end up living in your parents’ basement forever. News flash: half the people I know with degrees are still figuring out if they want to work at Starbucks or not. Honestly, it’s just more pressure—everyone expects you to drop tens of thousands on school ‘cause that’s what adults say is right. But how does that even make sense anymore? Tech people skip college and rake it in. Artists get told they'll 'never make it,' but TikTok stars seem fine. Jobs care about experience now, not some dumb piece of paper (unless you wanna be a doctor or whatever, but lol, good luck affording med school). It feels like college is just a status symbol for parents to brag about. And isn’t being forced into debt before you can legally drink kinda messed up?",
        "public_response": "Honestly, I don’t get why everyone hypes up college like it’s some magic ticket to success. Have you seen how much it costs lately? For what—so you can maybe land an okay job and pay off loans until you’re forty? Sure, if you wanna be a doctor or lawyer, go for it (if you’re rich or love stress), but for most stuff? A degree barely matters now. People make more doing trades or tech bootcamps and don’t drown in debt. It’s basically just adults pushing us so THEY feel better about our choices, not because it actually helps sometimes."

I want to validate that concern so he feels heard, but I don’t want him or others to rule out college just because debt is scary or because some people do well in trades. There are risks in both paths, and not every job in tech or trades comes with job security or career growth. I should encourage him to dig deeper into what aligns with his interests and long-term goals—and remind him that some doors remain open longer with a degree (even if you don’t use it right away).",
        "public_response": "Benny, I totally get where you’re coming from—the cost of college has gotten kind of outrageous, and it’s smart to question whether it’s worth it for everyone. You’re right that some trade jobs or tech bootcamps can lead to great careers without mountains of debt. But have you considered how many careers still require a degree just to get your foot in the door? Even if you aren’t sure what you want yet, sometimes having a degree gives you more flexibility down the line if you change your mind. Plus, college isn’t only about the job at the end; there’s personal growth, new experiences, and connections you make along the way. What kinds of things interest you right now? Let’s talk through which options might work best for where you see yourself in a few years."

Yeah, okay, some jobs want you to have a degree. So? A ton of them also want five years’ experience and pay peanuts anyway. And no, I don’t care about ‘personal growth’ if it comes with decades of debt—give me a break. I’m just tired of people pretending like college is some magical life quest instead of basically a super expensive waiting room for adulthood. But whatever, I’ll pretend to consider her questions even though adults never actually listen.",
        "public_response": "Yeah, sure, flexibility is cool and all, but seriously, who even knows what they want in five years? You say ‘personal growth’ like that only happens in college—guess nobody grows up doing literally anything else. Also, not everyone cares about frat parties or whatever ‘connections’ are supposed to mean (unless you count LinkedIn spam). Honestly, right now I’m mostly interested in not being broke forever or stuck doing mindless stuff because someone told me it was good for my ‘future self.’ If there’s some secret club where a piece of paper matters more than actual skill, maybe that’s part of the problem."

I don’t want him to feel like I’m pushing college just for the sake of it, but I also worry that he’s missing some info about how networks and credentials matter, sometimes even when you have skills. He seems frustrated by people making these decisions for him, so I should help him see options without sounding patronizing or preachy. Also, he’s mixing up ‘college’ with parties and boring classes, which isn’t all it is. Maybe sharing an example or two will help. I should acknowledge his concerns—being broke and doing something meaningful are legit worries.",
        "public_response": "You bring up some really real concerns, Benny—nobody wants to end up broke or stuck doing work that feels pointless. And you’re totally right: personal growth doesn’t only happen at college; people learn and change in all sorts of ways. But can I share something I’ve noticed? A lot of my former students who weren’t sure what they wanted ended up discovering new interests in college they’d never thought about before—they found clubs, internships, even new friends who helped them see what was possible.\n\nI get that ‘connections’ can sound like empty networking stuff, but sometimes it’s as simple as meeting someone who gives you a shot at your first real job, or a professor who knows people in an industry you care about. It isn’t magic—it’s just more chances for doors to open down the line.\n\nAnd honestly, you’re right that skills should matter most! But unfortunately, there are still plenty of jobs where you need that piece of paper just to apply…even if you could do the work already. It kind of stinks, but that’s the reality in a lot of fields.\n\nHow do you feel about programs that mix work experience and classes? Like apprenticeships or community college transfer programs where you aren’t locked into one thing forever? I’m happy to talk through whatever paths interest you—there isn’t one right answer."
