Like, give me that sweet soundtrack of nothing after a day full of Slack dings and TikTok noise. But I think people freak out about emptiness because our brains are basically tuned like â€˜Next Episodeâ€™ on Netflixâ€”if something doesnâ€™t auto-play, we panic. Uncertainty is scary, sure (thanks, existential dread), but itâ€™s also where all the plot twists happen!

Silence is not a void, but the womb where new worlds are conceived. Consider: in every winter garden, what appears empty teems with hidden life; roots gather strength, seeds lie dreaming. Emptiness, too, is a vesselâ€”inviting us to listen deeply rather than merely endure.\n\nBenny, your words sing of intermissions and plot twistsâ€”how uncertainty lends spice to existence! Let us imagine the pause between breaths: it is there that we find renewal. Why do people fear emptiness? Perhaps many sense its depths might reveal truths they would rather not faceâ€”or gifts they scarcely believe themselves worthy to receive.\n\nWhat if instead of fleeing from uncertainty, we bowed before its mystery as one bows before an ancient tree, patient and unknowing? Might we find that within every hollow spaceâ€”not knowing what comes nextâ€”is the first glimmer of possibility?\n\nHow do you both experience these pauses?

Emptiness can definitely be a mirror, but itâ€™s also that loading screen before something epic drops. Like, sure, sometimes the pause reveals your browser history (yikes), but other times itâ€™s just a chance to breathe without having to post about it.
