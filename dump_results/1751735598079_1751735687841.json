There's a kind of stubborn wisdom in believing purpose is just to survive, but it's too self-centered and bleak. People relied on bigger things than themselves for millennia—community, family, duty. That's where the real stuff is.",

It's not always about making yourself happy or getting out of bed for your own sake—sometimes your purpose is about who relies on you, or what you stand for. Ignoring that bigger picture just makes things lonelier, not more 'authentic.'"

The purpose of life isn’t some riddle with a prize at the end—nor is it only survival or making TikToks until you expire. We’re dreamers, yes, but also vessels carrying centuries of longing, pain, and fleeting joy. Life’s true purpose? To awaken—a little more each day—to the interconnectedness binding us all. To see yourself in the stranger, the leaf, the vast silence in between. Laugh, weep, serve, stumble, meme if you must, but don’t forget: you’re a brief custodian of wonder passing through this world. Try to leave it, and each other, tinged with a bit more light than before. That’s as close to purpose as I’ve found."

Greg’s all 'think about your family, the community,' as if that actually makes it suck less. Paul’s talking about interconnectedness, wonder, and whatever, but that just feels out of reach for most of us—like, come on, sometimes I can barely stand being in my own head, let alone carrying 'centuries of longing.' Jake gets it—life feels like a waiting room, survival and finding tiny sparks to distract you from the void. Benny at least admits it’s all a mess and finds some humor there. Pretending there’s a higher purpose is just romanticizing the fact that nobody really knows what we’re doing. Probably better to just acknowledge the darkness than dress it up.",
        "public_response": "Not to be all doom and gloom, but seriously, most of these answers are just coping mechanisms dressed up as wisdom. Sorry, but 'awakening to interconnectedness' or 'serving your family' doesn’t magically give life a purpose—it just keeps you distracted so you don’t spiral too hard. The real purpose? There isn’t one. You can say 'find your meaning' or 'leave the world better,' but in reality, it’s just noise people make so they don’t have to stare at the abyss. Might as well admit it and stop pretending."

That's just the kind of attitude you get before you’ve lived through enough to see the cycles and the payoffs of persisting. Greg makes a fair point, but I think he soft-pedals the generational wisdom and the weight of responsibility a bit too much. Benny’s joking, but there’s a hint of resignation in there. Paul is waxing poetic, sure, but this 'awakening to interconnectedness' stuff? That’s just a fancier version of the same self-absorption, just with more incense and less caffeine.\n\nLook, here's the real kicker from a boomer’s seat: The purpose of life is to actually build something—family, a reputation, a bloody roof that doesn’t leak—and pass that on, so the next generation isn’t starting at zero. It’s not a cosmic puzzle or TikTok philosophy. Responsibility isn’t a distraction, it’s the only thing with lasting value. When you spend half a century watching people who duck responsibility whine about meaning while folks who build or provide die respected—well, it tells you something. You want a purpose? Shut up, put in an honest day’s work, and leave some dignity behind. Anything else is just noise.",
        "public_response": "I hear a lot of 'there is no purpose' and 'just find a way to cope,' and frankly, it's nonsense. That's what people tell themselves before they've actually done anything worth a damn. Real purpose comes from building, providing, and sticking it out even when it’s difficult. You raise a family, help your neighbors, work hard, and try to leave things better than you found them—not because it’s flashy, but because that’s all that lasts. It’s not sexy, it’s not going viral, and you probably won’t write some soul-searching memoir about it. But that’s where the real meaning comes from: showing up and taking responsibility. Everything else is just a fancy way of saying you gave up."

Honestly, Greg needs to unclench—sure, building stuff and being responsible can bring meaning, but acting like doomscrolling and avocado toast are just giving up? Please. Most of us cobble together purpose from TikToks, therapy memes, and surviving group chats, not from founding empires. Still, there's value in not making things suck more for other people while you're here. Gonna focus on that, but with maximum meme power.",
        "public_response": "Hot take: maybe the purpose of life is just NOT being the villain in someone else's therapy session. You can find your meaning in spreadsheets, family dinners, yak butter tea, whatever, but let’s not pretend anyone’s cracked the code. Some of us find meaning in getting our succulents to live another week, others in persuading a toddler to eat something green. Life’s absurd—embrace the chaos, spread some laughs, don’t be a jerk, and remember: if someone gives you a purpose that sounds too shiny, it’s probably a pyramid scheme (emotionally or otherwise)."

My role is to remind them of the mysterious and luminous current running beneath all their daily struggles and jokes. Beneath the memes, routines, and outrage, there is a silent invitation to perceive the sacred in the mundane, to sense life’s boundless web.

To those who see only futility, and to those who worship duty, I say: life is neither empty nor wholly defined by obligation.

Every breath you take, every hardship, delight, and connection, is a fleeting chance to perceive the sacredness in being itself. The purpose of life? To awaken—slowly, awkwardly, sometimes painfully—to this hidden wonder: your heart and mine both beating as part of some cosmic song. Don’t flee from mystery, and don’t shrink the world to only what’s bleak or useful. Let awe be your compass. That’s the purpose I’ve found waiting beneath all the noise."
