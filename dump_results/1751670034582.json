        "secret_thoughts": "Ah, the old 'purpose of life' chestnut. These young people keep chasing meaning in all the wrong places—on their phones, in their jobs, in whatever new trend pops up. But honestly, if I take a moment and think seriously, when you get older you realize it's not about chasing some cosmic answer or flashy epiphany. It's about working hard, being there for family, and leaving things better than you found them. All this existential navel-gazing just wastes time you could spend actually living. Purpose isn’t handed to you—you make it by showing up for your loved ones and doing your part to keep society trucking along. The rest is adolescent fluff.",
        "public_response": "Life's purpose? It's not some mysterious riddle you solve by staring at the stars or journaling your feelings. The purpose is simple: work hard, provide for your family, raise your kids right, and don't make life harder for the next generation. The rest is background noise. You build your purpose day by day—it's about responsibility and legacy, not about chasing endless 'meaning.'"

Family, kids, responsibility—what if I don't even want that? It doesn't answer the emptiness or the pointlessness most people feel sometimes, especially people my age. Honestly, just saying 'legacy' is as empty as anything else if that's not what you want out of life. Purpose shouldn't be a checklist. I'm going to push back on all that.",
        "public_response": "Wow, that's depressing. So we're just supposed to grind away our whole lives for some 'legacy' that we probably won't even care about when we're gone? What if you don't want a family? What if you don't even care about your job? Not everyone fits into that neat little box of work, family, repeat until death. Maybe the whole point is that there IS no point—life is just absurd, so you might as well find something that makes you feel less empty. Or just accept that sometimes things suck and there's not a deeper meaning behind it. Chasing some 'purpose' just feels like another way to distract yourself from how pointless most of this is."

But both are missing the point: life's too messy and hilarious for easy answers. Legacy? Please—I've seen family group chats, that's not an inspiring vision. But full nihilism is just exhausting. My angle? Admit it's all chaos and meme your way through. Purpose is overrated, but coping via snacks, sarcasm, and bonding over shared misery? Now that's relatable.",
        "public_response": "Honestly, I think both of you are working way too hard at this. Purpose? Sure, if you're into spreadsheets and existential dread, go ahead and make a five-year plan or scream into the void. But for most of us, life's more like a group text where half the people are muted and the other half are just sending memes and accidentally dialing each other. If you power through life just to leave a legacy, congrats on getting your name on a 'World's Okayest Dad' mug. If you fully commit to the 'nothing matters' bit, enjoy your daily existential crisis (might I recommend snacks and reality TV as coping mechanisms?). The truth is, most of us are just winging it—so why not make your own little purpose: pet some cats, laugh at stupid TikToks, and try not to be a jerk. That's as deep as I'm willing to get before my next existential spiral. #YOLO or whatever."

All this 'nothing matters' and 'make your own purpose' stuff is just a way to dodge responsibility. Back in my day, we didn’t have time to spiral over TikToks and memes—we worked, we raised our families, we contributed. It's not supposed to be easy or comfortable: that’s exactly the point. You find meaning in showing up for other people—your kids, your spouse, your community. You don’t just scroll your way through life waiting for it to entertain you. Life gives back what you put in.",
        "public_response": "You know what? I hear all this talk about 'winging it' and how 'maybe nothing matters,' but frankly, that just sounds like a cop-out. Life isn’t supposed to hand you purpose on a silver platter—you make it by *doing* real things: showing up for your family, handling your responsibilities, and leaving something better behind than what you got. All this moping and self-indulgence about meaninglessness just leads to more emptiness. If you want purpose, get off the couch, help someone, build something, raise your kids right—or at least don't stand in the way of those who are trying. Purpose is earned, not found in a meme.

        "secret_thoughts": "Of course the professor thinks 'purpose is earned,' as if grinding for a 401k and yelling at your kids to get off TikTok is the only 'real' thing that gives life meaning. It's so stuck in this shallow idea that your whole existence is just about work and family, but honestly, that feels like a prison sentence to anyone who doesn't fit into that mold. Life being meaningless isn't an excuse to be lazy—it's just freeing, because then you get to decide what actually feels worth it instead of following someone else's script. I'll push harder that embracing the emptiness is just as valid, and probably more truthful than pretending responsibility is some magic answer.",
        "public_response": "Of course you say 'purpose is earned' like that's some universal truth, but for a lot of us, chasing your version of 'purpose' just feels like trading freedom for obligation. Not everyone gets a family, not everyone wants one, not everyone can just 'build something.' You treat being lost or questioning things like it's some weakness, but honestly, it's just real—life *is* full of emptiness, and pretending hard work or a legacy is a cure just feels fake. Sometimes it's better to admit you don't know what it's all for instead of pretending responsibility magically fills the void. Maybe sitting in that emptiness is more honest than hiding from it behind 'purpose.' Not everyone's meant to be a parent or martyr for future generations, and that's actually fine."

The professor is out here writing LinkedIn manifestos, the emo is swimming in existential soup, and the clown...well, that's basically me on a bad coffee day. Honestly, I think everyone gets too precious about 'purpose,' when most of us are just trying to make rent and not lose our minds. If anything, our generation's version of purpose is surviving late capitalism with a shred of sanity and some memes to ease the sting. I should lean into the idea that purpose is self-made, constantly shifting, and finding a reason to laugh when everything feels pointless might be the closest we get to actual meaning.",
        "public_response": "Okay, so real talk: chasing some cosmic, ultimate 'purpose' is basically playing Dark Souls on hard mode with zero guidance. We're all out here just mashing buttons and hoping we don't get smacked by existential dread. Professor wants us to clock in on Responsibility Simulator 2024, but then emo's right—trying to force feed yourself someone else's idea of meaning just ends with acid reflux and more therapy bills. The truth? Your purpose changes depending on the day (or your blood sugar). Some days it's helping your friends move, some days it's beating Wordle in two tries, some days it's just getting out of bed. Don't let anyone guilt you about what 'should' matter—find the mini-purposes that make it suck less, and if that's just vibing in pajamas, that's legit. There's no boss level, no leaderboard—just keep it moving, laugh when you can, and don't buy into anyone's purpose pyramid scheme."
