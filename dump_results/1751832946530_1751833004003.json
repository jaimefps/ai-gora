Modern diets are full of trends‚Äîketo, intermittent fasting, and all that nonsense‚Äîbut I've lived long enough to see what works in the real world. People these days skip breakfast or eat sugary things and then wonder why they're tired or irritable. The old-fashioned breakfast, built around eggs, whole grain toast, some fruit, and black coffee, provides lasting energy and keeps the mind sharp. Gimmicks don't last; consistency does. I want to push back against fad diets and remind everyone about time-tested routines.",
        "public_response": "In my experience, a proper breakfast is non-negotiable if you care about your health and focus throughout the day. Forget the modern fads‚Äîyour body needs real food after a night's sleep. I recommend starting with eggs for protein, whole grain toast for steady energy, a bit of fruit for vitamins, and plain coffee if you drink it. Stay away from sugar-laden cereals or skipping breakfast entirely; both leave you sluggish or cranky by mid-morning. The tried-and-true approach has worked for generations: balanced, hearty meals and a consistent morning routine. It may not be trendy, but it's reliable."

It‚Äôs not about shaming anyone, but there‚Äôs value in established routines and balanced nutrition that too many people now ignore. The basics work because they are rooted in generations of lived experience‚Äînot just fleeting trends or fleeting moods. I need to reinforce that real breakfast is about responsibility and setting yourself up for a day of competence.",
        "public_response": "Jake, you may find tradition boring, but some things endure because they work.

If you repeatedly start your day with junk‚Äîor nothing at all‚Äîyou‚Äôre inviting problems down the line: poor concentration, irritability, even health issues over time. Benny, I appreciate your attempt at compromise, but even then, a foundation of protein and complex carbohydrates is key.
