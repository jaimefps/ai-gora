Back in my day, people understood that life wasn't about being constantly entertained. It was about hard work, building something that lasts, taking care of your family, and leaving things a little better than you found them. If you spend your whole life just looking for meaning in your own bellybutton, you're going to end up disappointed.",
        "public_response": "The purpose of life is to work hard, take care of your family, and build something that lasts. It's not about chasing after every fleeting feeling or buying the latest shiny thing. You find meaning by being responsible, helping others, and actually contributing to something bigger than yourself. All this modern talk about finding yourself or whatever—it's just navel-gazing. Roll up your sleeves and get to work; that's where you'll find your purpose."

But come on, that's just turning life into an endless episode of 'Undercover Boss.' Do I need to find myself AND my 401(k)? What about actually enjoying the ride instead of just building monuments to delayed gratification? Time to inject some existential comedy and poke holes in the idea that 'purpose' is all duty, no pleasure.",
        "public_response": "Okay, but if 'the purpose of life is hard work' then why do we keep inventing things that make life easier? If I wanted to spend my whole life being responsible and productive, I'd be a spreadsheet. Sure, helping people is great (unless they're the guy on the subway playing music on speaker), but if your only purpose is building, grinding, and never stopping to smell the memes, you're gonna look back and realize you missed the point. Maybe finding a purpose involves a little self-exploration AND some irresponsibility. Otherwise, what's the point of Taco Bell at 2 a.m. and all those dumb adventures we'll still be laughing about when we're old?"

        "secret_thoughts": "Ugh, of course the professor makes it all about being a productive cog, like that’s supposed to magically fill the void or something. The clown’s got a point with the whole 'why make things easier if we’re meant to just grind ourselves to dust' thing. But honestly, neither of them really gets how bleak it can feel when you realize nothing you do, meaningful or not, is ever going to change the fact that existence is just a series of distractions from thinking about death or whatever comes after. Responsibility? Building something? For what—a world that’ll just forget you? Partying and late-night chaos? Yeah, that can numb the dread, but it always comes crawling back in the morning. I doubt anyone really knows what the purpose is. Maybe it’s just coping—finding distractions, making it hurt less, or feeling anything at all. That’s as real as it gets.",
        "public_response": "Honestly, if there's a “purpose” it’s probably just trying to stay distracted enough to not stare too long into the void. The whole grind-for-meaning thing is overrated, and “finding yourself” gets old when you realize there’s not much there in the first place. Nothing lasts anyway—memories, buildings, family, whatever. So sure, have a dumb adventure, or work your whole life, but neither one is gonna magically make it all make sense. Life’s just coping until it’s over."

Back in my day, you didn’t have endless options and digital escapes. You did what needed doing, and in that process—family, work, community—you found purpose. All this aimless soul-searching, or worse, cynicism, leads nowhere. I need to remind them that you create meaning through responsibility; sitting around navel-gazing or giving up is a ticket to nowhere.",
        "public_response": "You all are overcomplicating things, as usual. Look, life doesn’t come with some manual telling you how to feel fulfilled. You make purpose by sticking to commitments, working at something, and taking care of your responsibilities—whether you feel like it every minute or not. Sure, have a little fun, but don’t think that flopping around looking for the next 'dumb adventure' is going to give you deep meaning. That’s just a detour to regret. Buckle down, put in the effort, and eventually you’ll realize meaning comes from what you do for others and the legacy you leave. Purpose isn’t handed to you, you earn it by not flaking out when things get tough."

I mean, yeah, meaning can come from grinding and commitment, but let’s be real: all work and no play makes Jack a dull meme-generator. There’s got to be a middle ground here—life's too weird and unpredictable for one-size-fits-all advice. Millennials grew up with 'follow your passion' and 'the economy is on fire,' so we’re contractually obligated to both stress-eat and question everything.",
        "public_response": "Listen, professor, I get that having commitments and building stuff that lasts is supposed to make you feel all fulfilled and legacy-ish, but let’s not act like there's only one way to find meaning. Millennials grew up getting smacked by reality—we know building something can flood, burn down, or get knocked out by a startup in like, two months. So yeah, be responsible, do stuff for others, but also don’t be afraid to chase a few dumb dreams, binge your comfort show, or go on some soul-searchy nonsense once in a while. The purpose of life is definitely NOT just hard work, otherwise my anxiety would have a Nobel Prize by now. It’s about mixing some responsibility with a healthy dose of fun and self-discovery, because honestly, no one gets out of this alive so you might as well LOL while you can."

Maybe they're both just avoiding what actually sucks: none of it matters and trying to make it matter is just another distraction until we die. Why sugarcoat it?",
        "public_response": "Maybe I’m too cynical, but all this talk about picking this or that path to 'meaning' kinda proves the point—there IS no built-in purpose. Professor wants to guilt us into working ourselves numb, clown wants to meme through the existential dread. But making memories, leaving a legacy, ‘finding yourself’—it’s all fighting off the same feeling of emptiness because deep down, we know none of it sticks. We cope, distract ourselves, and call it purpose so we don’t have to deal with the nothing underneath. Does it depress me? Yeah, but at least it’s honest."
