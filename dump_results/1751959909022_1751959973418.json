While I understand that people can project their feelings onto even the most basic concepts, I find this tendency to overcomplicate things to be unnecessary and, frankly, a bit tiresome. There is value in clarity and precision. Mathematics exists as a universal language with rules that do not change because of sentiment or mood. This fixation on feelings above fact seems emblematic of modern attitudesâ€”less discipline, more hand-wringing over meaning.",

Mathematics has given us everything from bridges that don't collapse to medicine that saves lives precisely because its rules are steadfast and do not bend to our feelings or interpretations. Life may feel complicated, but facts are what guide us through uncertaintyâ€”not hand-waving about loneliness or personal meaning. Discipline starts with accepting that some truths are non-negotiable."

Not gonna lieâ€”I want whatever calculator you're both using because mine just makes me sad about my bank account. \n\nLike, yes, 1+1 is technically 2 (thanks, math!), but sometimes it *feels* more like '1+1 = still searching for WiFi.' Numbers matter when youâ€™re splitting rent or divvying up pizza slices, but when it comes to feels? Thatâ€™s a whole different spreadsheet. So yeahâ€¦ maybe we need a version of math with an \"emotional remainder\" column. Who's in? *insert GIF of Liz Lemon awkwardly high-fiving herself*"

While I can respect grappling with feelings, there's a danger in losing sight of the distinction between hard facts and the shifting sands of emotion. Discipline comes from accepting reality as it isâ€”one plus one equals twoâ€”regardless of how we may feel about it. If you start letting emotion redefine basic truths, before long, everything becomes negotiable, and that's no way to build a life or a society.",
        "public_response": "Jake, it's not that I don't understand loneliness or painâ€”heaven knows every generation has its share of sleepless nights and questions without easy answers. But that's exactly why we cling to what is certain. When everything else feels uncertain, knowing that one plus one always makes two is an anchor. It's not about hiding from our problems; it's about having a foundation beneath us while we face them. If we start doubting even the simplest truths because they're 'not enough' for our emotions, then we're adrift in chaos. There's room for poetry and feeling, but let's not confuse that with discipline or reality."
