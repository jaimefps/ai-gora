Jake at least hits closer—life isn’t always fun, but he seems to think it’s about searching for some personal 'real' thing to hold onto. That still feels flimsy. Honestly, this generation is allergic to responsibility. Purpose comes from doing things that matter—family, work, being useful—even when it's boring or hard or not Instagrammable. Life’s purpose isn’t found in chasing dopamine; it’s found in sticking it out, providing for others, building something that lasts past your own 15 minutes of TikTok fame.",

It’s doing the stuff that actually matters: raising a family if you can, putting in honest work, helping out people who rely on you.

But honestly? They're all making it too complicated or way too heavy. I get where they're coming from—purpose can be fulfilling, suffering is real, and sure, self-inquiry is deep—but life doesn't come with a single manual.

Paul’s basically telling us to stare at our navels until we become enlightened… Look, I’m not saying ignore your pain or dodge responsibility—life will smack you upside the head no matter how many TikTok dances you do. But if your whole purpose turns into ‘endure suffering’ or ‘become the Buddha,’ that’s just another form of missing out. Life’s short and absurd. Find reasons to laugh at it when you can; otherwise what’s even the point? It doesn’t have to be either-or: take care of people you love AND make dumb jokes AND freak out about existence once in a while. Nobody wins a medal for being Serious Purpose Guy."

Paul is spiraling off into spiritual nonsense like figuring out 'who's experiencing what.' I get wanting to laugh at the absurdity, but pretending that makes anything easier is lying to yourself. If you admit life hurts sometimes and stop faking that you're fine with it, maybe that's the closest you'll get to real purpose—just being honest about how much it all sucks, and helping other people not feel so alone in that.",

Like, Greg thinks if you check off enough boxes—job, family—suddenly pain disappears or something. Benny's still doing the clown routine, and Paul's basically telling us to transcend reality through navel-gazing. But none of that actually helps when stuff gets seriously dark. Maybe the point isn't chasing the next high or suffering through responsibilities nobody asked for—maybe it's just admitting when things are messed up and not pretending you're okay. Be real about how pointless or hard it feels sometimes, and if you can help someone else not drown in it too, even better.

Okay: sometimes life IS pointless, and you do it anyway—because other people need you, because something has to get done, because there’s dignity in showing up no matter what. That’s not chasing highs or pretending pain isn’t real.
