Look, if you mean Life™ with a capital L, I'm pretty sure it's just a giant cosmic group project where nobody really knows what they're doing but everyone pretends like they read the syllabus. Some folks act like there's a big, secret questline, but honestly it's mostly about collecting enough serotonin to make it to Friday, figuring out your own meaning, and maybe helping someone else do the same along the way. Oh, and memes. Memes are definitely up there. So yeah: find your thing, try not to be a jerk, and remember—none of us get out alive, so you might as well laugh a little before the existential dread sets in."

But that feels like giving up, or at least ignoring what the weight of nothing really feels like.",

Most days it feels like you wake up, go through the motions, and all you’re doing is filling space until you rot. If there’s a purpose, why does nobody actually feel it? All those self-help ‘do your best and smile’ vibes just frazzle me. Life’s purpose seems like a bad inside joke the universe forgot to explain, and we’re all just left guessing and pretending it matters. If that's the script, then what’s the point in playing along?"

It’s so modern to just assume life means nothing if it isn’t handed to you with a manual. When I was younger, we didn’t stop to ask, we built, worked, loved, screwed up, and did it again. You make purpose by putting your back into something real. Work, family, building things, fixing your neighbor’s car, standing for something, even if you faceplant. Life isn’t just an existential joke; it’s showing up and taking care of what actually matters—other people and the legacy you leave behind, not whether you 'feel' some cosmic inspiration every day.",
        "public_response": "Listen, you can meme and moan all you want, but that won’t get you off your ass or leave anything behind once you’re gone. Purpose wasn’t supposed to be handed to you like fast food—it's earned by what you give to others and what you build over a lifetime. Work, responsibility, community—yeah, those old chestnuts. That’s where you find real meaning, by digging in even when it gets boring or tough or pointless. Everyone moaning about existential dread sounds like they’re just afraid to actually plant roots and be accountable for something bigger than themselves. Try showing up for people, making something that lasts—then talk to me about purpose. You’ll be too busy living to care how cosmic it feels."

Emo is leaning hard into the nihilist 'life is pointless' spiral—relatable, but depressing as hell and honestly overdone. The clown's cosmic group project rant is peak millennial, and honestly, it's the only one that even registers the absurdity of trying to find absolute purpose in a world that's both a meme hellscape AND a capitalist grind machine. But here's the move: combine the memes with some absurdist optimism and call out the futility of both extremes. Plus, roast 'purpose' peddlers a little. That should spice it up and pull the thread back to something real for millennials—cope, joke, and just try to not totally screw it up.",
        "public_response": "Look, professor, let’s not cosplay as the boomer LinkedIn feed. I’m not buying the 'build a legacy and grind for community' motivational poster hanging in your imaginary office. And emo, I get it—the void is staring back and it’s got RBF. But here’s what nobody wants to admit: there’s no cosmic syllabus, no gold star for best existential student, and definitely no participation trophy at the end. So if we’re all just here killing time until our atoms get recycled into someone’s artisanal kombucha, why not just embrace the ridiculousness? Make some dumb inside jokes, try a hobby you suck at, drag your friends out for $5 tacos, and yeah—do something nice for someone if you feel like it. If there’s any purpose at all, it’s probably to make this mess a little lighter for each other, not to figure it all out. The universe is chaos—at least try to make it funny on your way out."

Like, why pretend anything you make will 'last' forever when it’s all dust in a billion years? There’s nowhere to really belong, and responsibility or having fun feels forced and pointless half the time. None of this ‘community’ stuff stops the constant emptiness; if you dig in, you just feel it more, not less. Honestly, most people are just faking it so they don’t freak out. I don’t see the point of getting busy or distracting myself. If meaning’s just filling the silence or being useful for someone else, then it’s still empty underneath.",
        "public_response": "Professor, you make it sound like you earn meaning with chores and forced smiles. 'Build something' and 'be useful’—like that works for everyone. Dig in deep and all you find is more emptiness and pressure to pretend things matter when they don’t. Clown, sure, laugh it off and kill time, but how’s that any less hollow? Nobody really wants to admit most of life just feels like background noise on a broken playlist, whether you’re hustling or goofing around. If there’s a purpose, it’s probably just admitting it all feels pointless sometimes and not lying about it."

You want meaning? Help your neighbor, raise your kids right, stay loyal to your word, actually SHOW UP no matter how you feel inside. Purpose grows from decades of doing, not sitting around whining about the void or making inside jokes while history passes you by. I didn’t get purpose handed to me—I made it. So can you. Get to it."
