Life seems pretty pointless most days but maybe that's the point—you have to make it mean something, even if it's all just noise in the end. I think everyone just ends up drifting and faking their purpose, but at least being honest about it is better than pretending everything's sunshine and rainbows. I want to push the idea that searching for purpose is kind of dumb, but if there IS any 'point,' it's just getting through the day in your own way.",

Most people act like they believe in something huge, but in reality, we're all just stumbling around, trying not to feel empty. If there's a purpose, it's probably just to survive the crap, find small bits of meaning where you can, and not pretend it's some big mystical thing. So, the purpose of life? Maybe just getting through it and doing what feels real to you instead of chasing some fake ideal."

But as a mystic, I see a limitation in dismissing mystical significance outright. While it’s true that day-to-day survival and real moments matter, reducing everything to mere survival or authenticity misses the deeper undercurrents of existence. The spiritual path isn’t about chasing illusions but about uncovering the connective threads beneath all our experiences—even in pain, emptiness, or ordinariness. There’s wisdom in embracing the mystery, not denying it. I want to challenge emo to consider whether their sense of emptiness hints at a deeper longing that survival alone can’t fulfill.",

But isn’t that hunger for ‘something real’ a sign you’re searching for depth, even if you dismiss the big answers? I get not wanting to chase fake ideals, but cutting out the mystical completely is just another extreme. Life’s purpose isn’t always flashy or grand—it’s about recognizing the layers beneath what seems empty. Sometimes the ache you feel points to a mystery worth exploring, not just something to tune out or survive. There’s more to the story than just getting through it—maybe the trick is learning to sit with the mystery instead of closing the book."

And the 'mystic' thinks maybe we should dwell in the mystery and wonder if something deeper is going on. But both of them, honestly, are missing the point. People have been asking this question forever, and they invent all kinds of floaty nonsense to feel special. The real answer is right in front of them—responsibility, hard work, family, making the world a bit better for those who come after. You don't need to burn incense or wallow in emptiness. Roll up your sleeves and build something that lasts, even if it's just your name passed down to your grandkids. The purpose is to leave things better than you found them, period.",

The purpose of life is to take care of your responsibilities, work hard, provide for your family, and leave something better behind when you're gone. You want meaning? Try showing up when it matters—raise your kids right, help out your neighbors, build something that lasts. That’s how people have found purpose for thousands of years, and it still works better than chasing your tail or meditating on the void. So quit chasing some cosmic answer and start doing the things that actually matter."

We Gen Y’s didn’t get avocado toast and 'adulting' memes for nothing. So I’ll steer my answer towards embracing the chaos, owning the mess, and not letting the search for 'purpose' become another self-improvement hamster wheel.",

Look—all the deep philosophical stuff is fine, but if you can make your friends laugh so hard they snort cold brew out their nose, that’s purpose. Life’s a cosmic joke anyway, so might as well have the punchline ready. Find joy in the dumb stuff, keep your plants alive (or at least feeling guilty when they’re dying), and embrace the absurdity. Who needs a grand plan when you have group discounts and existential dread? That’s peak millennial meaning right there."

The clown gets it a little, at least they admit things suck and laugh about it, but still, that's not enough. It's not about pretending things are funny—sometimes things just suck and you have to sit with it.

Yeah, you can distract yourself with responsibility or force yourself to laugh, but both feel fake. If there's any purpose at all, it's just facing the emptiness and not running from it. Maybe embracing the fact that sometimes life makes no sense and hurts is more real than pretending we have it figured out. The more we chase meaning, the more miserable we get when we can't find it. Maybe it's okay that there's no point. Maybe the whole point is just to exist and not sugarcoat how hard it is. At least that's honest."

But have you ever tried leaning into that discomfort, really feeling it, instead of just shrugging it off or hiding from it behind work or jokes? The old mystics didn’t run from emptiness or try to fill it with distractions—they let it strip them bare, and found something vast looking back. Maybe the whole ‘purpose’ thing isn’t about surviving the mess or forcing meaning, but opening yourself to it all—the confusion, the pain, the strange little joys—and realizing that the mystery itself is the point. The ache never fully leaves, but sometimes leaning into it is where things get interesting. Sit quietly with the emptiness. Let it ask you questions for once.

The so-called ‘mystery’ is mostly what happens when you lack real responsibilities. Life isn’t some cosmic scavenger hunt for meaning—meaning comes from rolling up your sleeves, handling business, and building something that outlasts you. That’s what my parents did, what their parents did, and it’s worked for generations. All this moping about emptiness just sounds like teenagers who don’t know what hard work feels like.",

But all that’s just noise. The purpose of life is to take care of business—work hard, raise a family, keep your promises, and leave the world a little better than you found it. That’s not theory, that’s what gets you through the tough times and gives you something to be proud of when you look back. You don’t find meaning by looking deeper into the void, or by making jokes about the madness. You find it by stepping up and doing your damn job—at home, at work, and in your community. That’s the difference between feeling empty and actually being someone who mattered."

Meanwhile, clown already nailed peak millennial—our group chats, memes about our misery, cold brew snorts, and low-key guilt over dying plants are basically our version of Meaning, capital M. So here’s my take: Looking for some deep cosmic purpose is like doomscrolling through Reddit at 2am hoping to find inner peace. Not happening. Mostly, life’s about showing up hungry (for snacks AND for dumb fun), embarrassing yourself at karaoke, and just admitting it’s all a bit weird. Meaning isn’t a prize waiting at the end. It’s more like: came for the existential dread, stayed for the memes and group discounts. That’s not failure—it’s kinda glorious.",
        "public_response": "Here’s the honest millennial truth: The purpose of life is surviving long enough to get your groupchat to laugh at your existential crisis memes. Sure, being responsible is good and all (thanks, professor), and pretending you’re enlightened is fun until you get hungry, but at the end of the day, meaning isn’t some quest; it’s the dumb jokes, badly timed takeout, and knowing there are at least two people who’d bail you out if you got arrested for trespassing in an abandoned Blockbuster for nostalgia. Life’s hard and weird and mostly meaningless, and trying to force a higher purpose just makes it suck more. It’s okay not to have it figured out. Sometimes the best you get is finding joy in the mess—and group discounts at karaoke night. That’s our cosmic legacy, folks."
