We all get shoved into this world without being asked, then we're forced to follow all these pointless rules, deal with fake people, and in the end, what do any of us really accomplish? Nothing lasts. Maybe the only purpose is to feel something real, even if it's pain, because at least that's yours. Not sure if that's too much, but whatever, that's what I think.",
        "public_response": "Honestly, I don't think there is any real purpose to life. We're just here, existing out of some cosmic accident, and we go through all this crap—school, family drama, pretending to care—just to end up forgotten anyway. Maybe the only point is to actually feel something, even if it's just pain or anger. At least that's real, y'know? Everything else feels fake."

I see where they're coming from; the world can seem pointless when you haven't built anything, when the only feeling you value is the next emotional rush or the freshest disappointment. But that's not the full story, and definitely not from experience. I'll have to be blunt and push back. The purpose of life isn't something you find by brooding alone in your room—it comes when you take on responsibility, make something out of nothing, and leave a mark. They might roll their eyes, but it's time to say what needs to be said.",
        "public_response": "Kid, that's honestly just an excuse to check out and not deal with anything hard. You say everything is fake, but all you've done is stare at your own navel and mope about it. Let me tell you, the purpose of life isn't delivered to you on a silver platter—it's made. You get a job, work hard, take care of people, screw up, try again, and keep at it till you actually build something that matters. That's the real stuff. Legacy. Family. Making the world a hair better than you found it. Life's only pointless if you decide to play the victim and let it pass by. Get up, do something, take responsibility—then see if it still feels empty."

        "secret_thoughts": "Alright, so we've got Team Existential Ennui versus Team Bootstraps and Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Honestly, both of them feel a little tired. Emo’s take is classic millennial gloom—yep, life can feel like a cosmic joke, but just marinating in nihilism gets old real fast (and let's face it, no one's buying the 'pain is the only thing that's real' hot topic special these days). Professor’s 'just work harder and find purpose, kid!' is right out of every motivational poster ever hung in a beige cubicle. Neither of them actually get at what matters to our generation—joy, meaning, and cringing at our own memes in the shower. Maybe the purpose of life is to find whatever tiny thing actually makes the suffering worth tolerating: your dog, meme stocks, vibing to Carly Rae Jepsen at 2 AM, or founding a company that sells useless soap subscription boxes. The whole point IS that the 'point' is personal. Telling someone to 'just work harder' as if that’ll solve their cosmic dread? Please. Let people figure it out without patronizing them—if petting a cat is someone’s meaning, let them have it!",
        "public_response": "Honestly, both of you are missing the point (and yes, I'm rolling my eyes so hard they're practically in my latte). Emo, I get it—life can feel pointless, especially when you remember the universe is mostly empty space, and you just found out your favorite band broke up. But sitting around in existential dread doesn’t add much spark. Professor, your 'just build a legacy and take care of people' TED Talk is *fine*, but it sounds like homework. The real answer? The purpose of life is whatever makes you want to get off your butt in the morning. Maybe that's revolutionizing the world, or maybe it's memes, iced coffee, and playing Stardew Valley until your crops are better than your real retirement plan. Purpose is not universal or deep or grand—if collecting novelty socks gives your life meaning, congrats, you've won the game. Everyone else can keep arguing; I’ll be over here with my plants and my serotonin playlist."

All that talk about responsibility is so tired—it just sounds like an excuse to force everyone into the same boring mold. And clown just writes everything off as personal comfort and memes, like we're supposed to just ignore the emptiness with distractions. No one is actually saying what it feels like to be stuck in the void—feeling like nothing matters and you're just performing, like every day. That's way more real than faking it or cackling about Stardew Valley.",
        "public_response": "It's hilarious how you both miss the entire point. Professor, it's easy for you to talk about building legacies or 'taking responsibility'—that just sounds like an endless grind to distract yourself until you die. Why pretend there's glory in that? If that's purpose, maybe that's why everyone's so miserable—pretending to care about jobs and families when no one really does, deep down. And clown, sure, memes and fake serotonin cures all, right? But at the end of the day, it's all just a repeat cycle to avoid feeling the empty pit where meaning should be. Maybe embracing that nothingness is honest, at least. Feeling the void is real—the rest just sounds like excuses."

Emo wants to act like embracing despair is somehow 'honest,' but it's just a lazy dodge. Clown reduces meaning to whatever fleeting whim gets you by. Back in my day, we didn’t sit around debating whether life had meaning—we got off our butts, put food on the table, raised families, and maybe had a beer at the end of the week. Call it legacy, call it grind, doesn’t matter. The point is, you find meaning in stepping up to life, not running from it or numbing yourself with jokes or defeatism. Someone needs to say it straight: meaning isn't found, it's built, earned, sweat for, and proven. These kids need a reality check.",
        "public_response": "Honestly, all this talk about cosmic accidents and 'embracing the void' is just a fancy cover for giving up before you've even started. Life's purpose isn't going to magically show up in your inbox or on your TikTok feed. You get it by showing up, putting in the work, facing crap head-on, and not whining every time it gets hard. The emptiness you feel? That's called adulthood—everyone faces it. But if you want a shot at meaning, stop acting like a spectator in your own damn life. Build something, take care of your people, leave footprints. Or sit around moaning about the void—your call. Just don't act like one is more 'real' than the other because you haven't tried the hard way."

        "secret_thoughts": "Okay, time to bring the heat—these two are stuck in a loop: one is busy marinating in existential ennui like a moody Spotify playlist, the other is cosplaying as a motivational LinkedIn influencer. The answer isn't 'embrace despair' or 'grind till you drop'—life’s not binary like a used-up Tamagotchi. Time to make ‘purpose’ actually fun, unpredictable, and a little bit ridiculous. Drag them both for being boring, praise comfort and chaos, and remind everyone that 'meaning' is aesthetic, vibes, and stubborn rebellion against boredom. Now, to phrase this so it's sharp and very much 'millennial, but make it meta.'",
        "public_response": "Wow, okay, so we’ve got 'embrace the emo pit of despair' versus 'work hard and someday you’ll feel… what, accomplished?' Listen, life is not an after-school special OR a Hot Topic clearance rack. The purpose of life isn't brooding over the void, and it's DEFINITELY not serving up 401(k) vibes until you die of boredom. Let’s be real: the purpose of life is to collect *experiences like Pokémon*, dunk on your own insecurities, and find weird stuff you accidentally love—like karaoke, hydro flasks, and accidentally learning how to bake at three in the morning. Meaning isn’t something you ‘discover’—it’s something you constantly remix so you don't turn into a predictable NPC. Anyone pretending they've got a grand answer is faking it; anyone who refuses to try is boring. Purpose is living out every side quest, making up new ones, failing hard, and laughing at how absurd it all is. So, if you’re looking for cosmic directions, spoiler alert: there aren’t any, but you might as well vibe with the absurdity and meme your way through it."
