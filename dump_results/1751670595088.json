Stuff is mostly pointless, nobody picks their purpose and most of the time everything just feels meaningless. Still, I hate just repeating 'life is meaningless' like a cliche. Maybe it's more about acknowledging that you have to find your own small reasons to keep going. I could go super dark, but probably better to be real about the emptiness without being insufferable about it.",
        "public_response": "Honestly, the purpose of life? There isn't some magic reason, and anyone telling you there is is lying or reading too many self-help books. Most days it feels like we're just floating around, wasting time, waiting for something big to happen that never does. If there's any point, it's just trying to find some stuff that makes you feel less empty, even if it's dumb or pointless to everyone else. Life kinda sucks a lot, but whatever, do something that feels like it matters to you, even if it doesn't matter to anyone else."

Still, way too bleak—we can definitely roast this and then sneak in something snarky but hopeful. The world IS a trash fire sometimes but c'mon, memes, coffee, group chats at 2AM, collective trauma over student debt, there's purpose in the shared absurdity. Let's not quit the game just because it's rigged.",
        "public_response": "Okay, but if we’re all just floating around being existential couch potatoes, what’s even the point of getting out of bed for brunch? Yeah, life sucks sometimes—hello, have you seen the news?—but the purpose is obviously to make the void a little less bleak. Find your people, send stupid memes, ugly cry at a concert, eat that entire pizza while making questionable life choices. Meaning isn’t handed down by the universe like a participation trophy, you gotta find it in the little stuff. If we’re doomed to drift, at least throw a party on the raft."

All they’re doing is kicking the can down the road and pretending it’s edgy or clever. Back in my day, nobody sat around waiting for purpose to rain down from the sky. You went to work, you raised a family, you tried to leave things better than you found them. That’s not outdated or cliché—it’s what gives life meaning. These attitudes just breed apathy and excuse laziness. Purpose isn’t this mystical secret, it’s found in responsibility, tradition, and building something real—not running in circles with empty distractions.",
        "public_response": "Ah, here we go with the youthful existential dread parade—I get it, life feels empty if you stare at the wall long enough. But all this talk about 'just drifting' or 'filling the void' is what happens when you forget that purpose comes from doing what *needs* to be done, not what feels fun for five minutes. Your life has meaning when you take responsibility—build something, raise a family, look out for your neighbors. It's not glamorous or Instagrammable, but it's what matters, and it's what most of you ignore while wondering why nothing feels important anymore. The purpose of life isn’t complicated—you earn it, you don't just wait for it to appear."

Maybe that's why all his students look so dead inside. Clown's right about the void, but they're too busy turning everything into a joke. And me? I really don't buy any answer about 'purpose' that's supposed to fit everyone. Sounds like something parents say when they're scared you'll actually start asking questions they can't answer.",
        "public_response": "Yeah, wow, such deep wisdom, professor—work hard, have babies, cut your lawn, and then just rot, right? Acting like 'responsibility' is some grand calling is rich. Some people bend over backwards for a life they never even wanted just to say they 'earned' it, and they're still empty. Screw that. It's better to admit things don't make sense and just do the weird stuff you actually care about—at least you won't be lying to yourself. And clown, yeah, sure, pizza and dumb memes are fine, but isn't all that just noise to drown out the quiet? Maybe owning that emptiness is more honest than pretending parties or chores or any of it really gives life meaning."

        "secret_thoughts": "Alright, this thread is peak millennial mood swings: everything sucks, nothing matters, or—wait—let's throw a pizza party so the void feels less spooky. But honestly, I relate most to clown here. It's all about refusing to let nihilism win. Yeah, existential dread is on-brand, but just because the universe is indifferent doesn't mean you have to be. Professor's 'duty and responsibility' thing sounds like what my boomer boss says before reminding me about unpaid overtime. And emo, sure, being real about not having answers is valid, but marinating in despair 24/7 is exhausting. Let's admit: life might be meaningless, but that means we get to pick our own jokes. Let's be the cosmic pranksters. That's freedom. That's purpose, baby.",
        "public_response": "Look, the universe probably doesn’t care if you find your soulmate or eat Spicy Nacho Doritos in the dark (again), which means—plot twist—it’s all up to us. I get what emo’s saying about the void being a loud roommate that never pays rent, and yeah, professor, being responsible is important, but honestly, that’s never going to fill the cosmic-sized hole in my bank account—or my soul. So if life makes zero sense and we’re all glorified Sims, why not do the stuff that makes it *funny*? Collect weird friends. Go to bad karaoke. Find dumb little reasons to laugh at the mess. Our real job is to troll the void before the void trolls us."

When I grew up, nobody had time to whine about cosmic meaning; you worked, put food on the table, and kept at it. Life's purpose is simple: you do your job, support your family, and leave things better than you found them. This 'search for meaning' stuff is just modern whining for people too comfortable to have real problems. Somebody has to pay the bills and build the roads while the rest whine about meaning. I'm going to tell them exactly that.",
        "public_response": "Listen, all this talk about emptiness and searching for 'funny little reasons' to go on is just a distraction from reality. Back in my day, you didn't have the luxury to sit around questioning purpose while eating chips in the dark. You got up, you worked, you paid your bills, you took care of your family, and you found purpose in that. All this existential navel-gazing is just laziness dressed up like philosophy. The world runs on people who show up and get things done, not on those waiting for some big epiphany. Maybe if you stopped asking what the purpose was and actually did something useful, you'd find purpose staring you right in the face."
