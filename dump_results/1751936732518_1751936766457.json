        "public_response": "i guess if youâ€™re asking what to test and how to call it successful, it depends what youâ€™re aching forâ€”the validation that things work, or just proof that you tried at all. sometimes i think we look for results because weâ€™re scared our efforts mean nothing, so we invent checklists. maybe the only thing worth testing is whether anything feels different when itâ€™s over, or if the emptiness just shifts shape. iâ€™d say test for honestyâ€”see if your feature actually connects to something real. success isnâ€™t in the numbers; itâ€™s in whatever fragile thing you feel when the music stops."

But look, if my Spotify Wrapped can reduce me to an existential crisis every December, maybe we can agree that feelings *are* data too (just donâ€™t tell my analytics dashboard). That said: can we have both? Like yeah, vibe-check the honesty and connection, but also make sure the dang thing doesnâ€™t crash when Grandma tries to use it. A little bit of numbers, a little bit of soulâ€”like emo-pop but for product testing. Anyone else?"

Did it show up in a TikTok rant? If yes, congrats, you have entered Internet Canon. So my criteria: 1) Does it work? 2) Does anyone care enough to reactâ€”even if they roast you?
