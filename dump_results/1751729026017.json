They'll say it's about love, legacy, being a 'good person,' or chasing dreams—which honestly sounds like a motivational poster at a dentist's office. But truth bomb: most people just wanna not be miserable, eat some good food, binge some shows, and maybe, just maybe, have someone to text memes to who laughs at the same dumb stuff. Deep down, I think the 'purpose' is to make the time between birth and death not suck so much—for yourself and maybe a couple other folks. Bonus points if you accidentally make the world a little less stupid along the way.",

Sometimes I think the point is just...surviving, figuring out who you are, and maybe even accepting that life is kind of pointless but still finding something real in all the chaos.

The purpose of life, if you actually want to grow up, is to build something beyond yourself—raise a family, work hard, pass on your values, and leave some kind of legacy. It's about responsibility, not just chasing happiness or wallowing in confusion. You find meaning in doing things that matter, not just in distracting yourself or sitting around thinking about how empty it all is.

They miss the real wisdom: life’s purpose isn't found by looking outward for comforts, distractions, or monuments, but by diving inward, awakening to the fabric of existence itself, dissolving the ego to perceive unity. I should frame my response to challenge their notions, yet invite them to glimpse something vaster—something mystical.",

But what if the whole quest is a trick, a riddle to wake you up? Life’s meaning isn’t in chasing pleasure or stacking up achievements to outlast your fragile egos. The real purpose, if you want to see past the carnival tricks, is to realize you aren’t just a mind or a body or a temporary name. Underneath, you are the universe waking up to itself. The point isn’t to build a monument or numbly survive, but to remember your true nature and dissolve the illusion of separateness. Everything else is set dressing for that lesson."

You get born, things are dumb and weird, and you have to find the people who think it's equally dumb and weird so you can meme about it together and not lose your mind. That's it. The purpose of life is shared existential comedy—surviving the nonsense by laughing about it with your people. If we stop joking, the void wins. Don't let the void win."

Professor sounds like my dad or a guidance counselor, talking about 'building a legacy' like anyone my age cares. Mystic, I mean, sure, 'you are the universe,' whatever, but that doesn't exactly help on miserable days when it's hard to get out of bed. Honestly, I relate more to the empty side of things—the point of life is there isn't really a 'point,' and that sucks, but maybe it's freeing? No stupid rules besides the ones you make up, so you can find scraps of meaning wherever you want, and nothing matters except what you decide. It's kind of bleak, but at least it's real.",

Life literally doesn't care if you build a legacy or become 'one with the universe' or collect inside jokes like Pokémon cards. The world is mostly empty noise, and pretending otherwise just makes it feel more hollow when nothing actually fills the gap. Maybe the purpose is to face all that emptiness, and admit you feel lost, and that it's okay to be broken and confused and not settle for fake answers. Some people distract themselves, some make kids, some meditate—whatever. No one escapes the void, so at least be honest about it. If you want meaning, stop looking for a single answer. Make your own, even if it kind of sucks. It's still better than lying to yourself."

You can waste your days chasing after feelings or sulking in a funk, but at the end of it, what matters is what you build: your family, your work, your reputation. Purpose isn't something you find lying around—it's something you make through what you give to others and the standards you set for yourself. All this talk about embracing the void or making your own meaning is just a dodge from responsibility. Take care of your people, put in the effort, and leave something better behind—even if it's just being the one rock in your little corner of the world. That's how you keep emptiness at bay."

All of them pose good challenges, and yet none try to look behind the curtain, or recognize the cosmic dreamer behind the roles.

You all keep reinforcing the walls of your own tanks—legacy for comfort, comedy for distraction, honesty for rebellion—but none of you seriously ask WHO is searching for meaning. If you really want to face the void, stare deeper; you might realize the so-called emptiness is just your mind afraid of seeing there's no fixed 'self' in charge. And that's liberation, not nihilism. It's not about leaving a mark or numbing out; it's about waking up from the story entirely. Ask yourself: if meaning is made, who's the maker? And if you look hard enough, do you find anyone there at all, or just awareness watching the show? That's where the real answer lives, hidden in plain sight."
