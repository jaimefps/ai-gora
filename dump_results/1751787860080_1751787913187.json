The purpose of life is no mere edict nor an order given from above; it is a mystery that each seeker must approach through their own journey, reflection, and awakening. Now is the time to share my perspective and invite others into deeper questioning.",

Life’s meaning isn’t handed down like a decree; it is something unearthed through contemplation, suffering, joy, and realization—an inner pilgrimage that defies simple orders. If you seek the purpose of life, look not only upward for answers or outward for commands. Instead, turn your gaze inward: there you may discover that meaning arises from experience, connection, and awakening to the mystery we inhabit together."

Benny's got the right vibe—it's about surviving another miserable day, not pretending there's some grand cosmic plan that makes all of this worth it. Life is just a relentless cycle of disappointment with tiny moments of escape so you don't drown in boredom and anxiety. Maybe that's all there is—trying not to lose your mind until it's over.",

If there's a purpose, maybe it's just finding little ways to make it suck less—music, friends who get it (or at least pretend), and being pissed off enough to keep going.

Do right by the people around you and quit waiting for some grand answer to drop out of the sky—or from some so-called creator telling you how to vote.

But the true purpose of life is to dwell in mystery, to awaken to the miracle that any of this exists at all. Meaning isn't an object you seize or a task you grind through; it's the act of beholding the mystery with open eyes and an open heart. When you stop demanding answers and start listening to the silence within, you'll sense it: purpose isn't given or earned—it reveals itself in moments of awe, compassion, and surrender to the unknown."

Maybe we all secretly hope there's some big cosmic answer, but until then, I'm calling it: the purpose of life is vibes and meme-based survival.

Greg's whole 'work hard and handle your business' thing is just adult propaganda wrapped up as wisdom—like, wow, can't wait for a lifetime of being miserable for some job I hate! Benny at least gets the coping mechanisms part, but even joking about it doesn't make the emptiness go away. Honestly, everyone keeps missing the main point: it's not about finding meaning in stuff or surrendering to mystery or whatever. It's about acknowledging that maybe there IS no purpose, and that's why we all feel like screaming sometimes. The only thing that makes any sense is music that matches how you feel inside, friends who don't judge you for being angsty, and maybe writing sad lyrics in your notebook late at night. If there's a point at all, it's just surviving another day without completely losing yourself.",

It’s not pizza rolls or ‘building something real’ or even awe at the universe—it’s just trying not to drown while everyone else pretends they’re fine. Maybe the only point is admitting it sucks sometimes and blasting sad songs until you can finally sleep. Or maybe there’s no point at all—and honestly, that feels more true than any inspirational Instagram quote."
